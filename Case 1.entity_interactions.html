    <body><strong>N.</strong> is a 19 <strong>year</strong> old single caucasian <strong>female</strong>, who is attending <strong>university</strong> and works <strong>part-time</strong> as a <strong>cashier</strong> for a pizza restaurant. She has a <strong>history</strong> of <strong>recurrent</strong> depressive <strong>episodes</strong>, which starts in the late fall/early <strong>winter</strong> <strong>months</strong>, and <strong>remits</strong> during the spring. She uses light <strong>therapy</strong> every <strong>morning</strong> for 30 <strong>minutes</strong>, as without it, she would be unable to function. Although her <strong>family doctor</strong> has recommended that she consider antidepressant <strong>medication treatment</strong>, <strong>N.</strong> has adamantly refused, stating that it is unnatural, as she tries to ingest healthy and natural foods. When she becomes depressed, she has <strong>symptoms</strong> of low <strong>moods</strong>, <strong>anhedonia</strong>, excessive <strong>fatigue</strong>, excessive <strong>sleep</strong>, increased appetite, carbohydrate <strong>cravings</strong>, and weight gain. Her <strong>family history</strong> is significant for her <strong>mother suffering</strong> from bipolar <strong>disorder</strong>, and who dies in a <strong>car accident</strong> when <strong>N.</strong> was only 12 years old. It is highly suspected that the car accident was a suicide. <strong>N.</strong> has refused to see a <strong>therapist</strong>, stating she does not need psychological <strong>help</strong>, and that she can deal with her <strong>mother</strong>’s death on her own. After the <strong>death</strong> of her <strong>mother</strong>, she and her <strong>brother</strong> were sent to live with their estranged <strong>father</strong> and step-<strong>mother</strong>, and their infant <strong>daughter</strong>, N.’s half-sister. She is the oldest of 3 siblings. <strong>Suffice</strong> it to say, <strong>N.</strong> did not get along well with her <strong>father</strong> and <strong>step-mother</strong>, and was jealous of all the <strong>attention</strong> her infant <strong>sister</strong> got from the family. When <strong>N.</strong> became depressed in the <strong>winter</strong> <strong>months</strong>, she locked herself in her <strong>room</strong>, and would sleep constantly, not contributing to the <strong>chores</strong> the family needed. When she was not sleeping, she would leave and spend <strong>days</strong> with her <strong>friends</strong>, without any <strong>check-ins</strong> with her parents. Eventually,she ran away from <strong>home</strong> after her <strong>graduation</strong> from high <strong>school</strong>, and was not found until her <strong>father</strong> shamed her on <strong>Facebook</strong> that his <strong>daughter</strong> was missing and is now a runaway. Humiliated, N. contacted her father and assured him she was safe. She eventually enrolled in <strong>university</strong>, and only has cursory <strong>contact</strong> with her <strong>father</strong> and siblings. Her first <strong>year</strong> in <strong>university</strong> was difficult, and she almost failed her <strong>classes</strong> due to sleeping too much when her <strong>depression</strong> would worsen like <strong>clockwork</strong> in the <strong>fall</strong> and winter. When <strong>spring</strong> would come around, she would have increased <strong>energy</strong> and could work for 12 <strong>hours</strong> a <strong>day</strong> and go out with her <strong>friends</strong> at <strong>night</strong> with only minimal sleep. She spends her <strong>summer</strong> doing <strong>lots</strong> of outdoor <strong>activities</strong>, as she likes to soak in the <strong>sun</strong>, and <strong>dreads</strong> each <strong>day</strong> after <strong>June</strong> 21st, when the <strong>sun</strong> exposure would decrease little by little with each passing <strong>day</strong>. <strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Major depressive <strong>disorder</strong>, <strong>recurrent</strong>, in partial <strong>remission</strong>, with seasonal pattern. Rule-out bipolar <strong>disorder</strong>, given the <strong>history</strong> of <strong>hypomanic</strong> <strong>symptoms</strong>, and family <strong>history</strong> of bipolar <strong>disorder</strong>. The <strong>patient</strong> had only a partial <strong>response</strong> to the current <strong>dose</strong> of light therapy. <strong>Treatment</strong>: 1) Will increase light <strong>therapy duration</strong> to 60 <strong>minutes</strong> every <strong>morning</strong>, from a 10,000 <strong>lux</strong> light box. Will need to monitor for any <strong>signs</strong> of <strong>mania</strong>, as light <strong>therapy</strong> may switch <strong>someone</strong> with an underlying bipolar <strong>disorder</strong> from depression to <strong>mania</strong>. 2) If no <strong>response</strong> in 1 to 2 <strong>weeks</strong>, then consider augmenting light <strong><strong>therapy</strong></strong> with cognitive behavioral <strong><strong>therapy</strong></strong> (CBT). 3) Recommend other helpful <strong>strategies</strong> for <strong>depression</strong>, including <strong>exercise</strong>, <strong>meditation</strong>, <strong>yoga</strong>, and outdoor <strong>time</strong> to increase sunlight exposure. 4) <strong>Treatment</strong> with antidepressant <strong>medications</strong> is a relative <strong>contraindication</strong>, as bipolar disorder has not been ruled out. 5) <strong>Return</strong> to clinic in 2 <strong>weeks</strong> for follow-up.</body>
